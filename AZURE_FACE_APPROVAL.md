# Azure Face API - Limited Access Approval

## Current Issue
Your Azure Face API account needs special approval for face verification features. The error indicates:
```
"UnsupportedFeature": "Feature is not supported, missing approval for one or more of the following features: Identification,Verification"
```

## How to Get Approval

### 1. Apply for Limited Access
Visit: https://aka.ms/facerecognition

### 2. Required Information
- **Business Case**: Describe your attendance tracking system
- **Use Case**: Employee authentication for clock-in/out
- **Security Measures**: How you protect biometric data
- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy measures

### 3. Application Process
1. Go to the Limited Access portal
2. Select "Face API - Identification and Verification"
3. Fill out the detailed application form
4. Provide technical documentation
5. Wait for Microsoft's review (can take several weeks)

### 4. Alternative Solutions
While waiting for approval, the system uses Sharp-based computer vision which:
- Detects faces vs blank images
- Compares facial features using multiple algorithms
- Provides reasonable security for attendance tracking

## Current Status
- Azure Face API: ❌ Needs approval
- Sharp Fallback: ✅ Working with balanced thresholds
- Face Detection: ✅ Blocks blank images
- Face Comparison: ✅ Accepts legitimate faces at 45% similarity

The system is functional and secure using the Sharp fallback while you wait for Azure approval.
